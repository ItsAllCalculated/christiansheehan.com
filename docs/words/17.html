        there's a girl with a pretty voice<br>
put your thoughts down and open up your ears<br>
because she is singing! "la-la-la" <br>
are the sounds of each of her tears<br>
<br>
sometimes she dreams of being a star<br>
on tour across the vast world of people<br>
and feelings infectious of ethereal colors<br>
will watch her tears swim passionately<br>
<br>
but sometimes she bleeds through her nose<br>
and vomits her harsh and sickening wisdom<br>
nobody is rough enough to hold her slippery grip<br>
not even I<br>
<br>
there is no point in saving her<br>
as she is her own mapped out red dotted line<br>
I just hope that it doesn't lead her back<br>
to her bedroom of acid rain and screams
