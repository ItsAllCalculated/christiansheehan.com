        September 12th
<br><br>Today, I took my dog for a walk. As usual, she refused to walk in a straight line and seemed to completely disregard the pulling of her leash. She freezes at the sight of people or, God forbid, another dog. At times, I have to carry her just so we can move forward. Anyway, I’m not writing here today to talk about my dog, but rather the strangely profound experience I had during my walk.
<br><br>There’s an elementary school in my neighborhood, very near where I live, that I often pass during walks. Usually, it’s not something I notice very much, but for whatever reason today, I decided to take a more observant look at it. I don’t know why. Maybe I was just very immersed in the atmosphere of the day. Autumn is soon on its way and we are starting to have these beautiful cloudy days. The beauty comes from their novelty as it’s the long-needed break from the aggressive sunny days of summer. I guess the new setting opened my eyes wider, in a figurative sense although almost literal as well, to my surroundings. The wind, the clouds, the cars passing by, the cooler weather, it evoked a melody in my head, one that hadn’t been heard with such clarity before. It was as if an orchestra was playing right in front of me.
<br><br>As I looked at the school, I was able to see through the front windows where I saw things like colorful posters, drawings of animals, and various toys. This struck a chord in me that I was not anticipating. To an entirely new generation of people, the school will be a place full of treasured memories. And although I have my own seemingly similar sentimental values from when I was a child, the vivid sensations I gratefully had in that moment made me realize that they are far from the same. In fact, they will never be the same. I am no longer an innocent child.
<br><br>I wish I was the kid who would break a bone or two attempting to climb the highest trees, but I was not. I wish I was the kid who would read books every night until my face turned blue, but I was not. I wish I was the kid who ran faster than all of their friends, but I was not. I tried to tell myself that it was OK. I reminded myself that our identities are limited and that no one can be everything. I took a deep breath.
<br><br>I dragged myself to this point in my life begrudgingly and barely made it. How can anyone see me the same way I see them? I have no stories to tell. I’m a fraud. In front of me, I see memories, but none of them are mine. I see love, pain, laughter, and heartbreak, but none of it is mine. I kept repeating to myself “it’s not mine”. The many kids, parents, and families associated with this school or to the entire neighborhood around me have all experienced a myriad of emotions. I should be clear, very strong emotions. Much stronger than any I was feeling then. For a moment, it felt like I could see all of everyone’s emotions throughout the past, present, and future, all in front of me at once. Which, to put it simply, was a lot to handle.
<br><br>As I continued on my walk, I felt uneasy. I was looking down, hand rubbing my face, just trying to process everything. I came home with this sudden urge to write, and now I’m putting pen to paper. But I need to do more than just write. I need to make something beautiful or just do something crazy. I can’t keep living like this. Maybe I’m being melodramatic, but it’s truly how I feel.
