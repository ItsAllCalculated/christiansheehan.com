A tree will branch out indefinitely. Its sole purpose is to grow as much as it can, to assert as much grace as it can until it physically cannot. I envy that. As I stare out my window at the tree on my front porch, I am reminded of what little courage I have. 
<br><br>    I’m a violinist, but I struggle to label myself as one. I play violin professionally, but my skills are nothing but embarrassing for the amount of experience I have playing it throughout my life. Maybe the general public would see nothing wrong with my playing, but anyone with any kind of musical expertise or sensitivity to the nuances of sound won’t find my performances at all impressive. A word that gets thrown around a lot is “uninspired”, and although it’s a term with a somewhat ambiguous meaning and it’s one that’s thrown around a lot in the music world quite arbitrarily, it’s something I take very personally. The worst part of it is that the more self conscious I get about it, the worse it gets. Sure, I’m making a living doing what I love as some would say, but it’s difficult for me to say that there is any love involved in what I’m doing at all.
<br><br>    Right now, I have a 1951 record featuring Jascha Heifetz, a violinist I idolize, playing beside me. It’s a performance of Franz Schubert’s Piano Trio in Bb. I am especially fond of the 2nd movement which is playing right now, a very pleasant, lyrical, and serene waltz. It’s a piece that gives my mornings just a bit more color, it makes them just a bit more vibrant I’d say. It also has a bit of a nostalgic charm, to me at least. This is a record passed down by my parents who would play a lot of classical music in my household growing up. Schubert was my mom’s favorite and soon became mine as well. The only other musician in my family is her father. My maternal grandfather played piano and although not professionally, I would say that I look up to him. I guess I just have this desire to partially identify myself with someone in my family.
<br><br>    I’ve tried listening to other recordings of this piece, but none have the same charm as the one featuring Heifetz. It’s part of the reason why I was inspired to pursue violin. There’s just something about performers like Heifetz, Kreisler, Menuhin, and Oistrakh that are so timeless. The clarity of new recording technology will never beat the beauty of one playing with passion, love, and especially courage. Courage like the tree on my front porch which I am still staring at and admiring.
