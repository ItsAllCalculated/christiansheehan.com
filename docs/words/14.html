        I feel sad but I don't know why<br>
I didn't forget because I never knew<br>
I can't say that I'm tired because I slept very well<br>
it's just that my neck finds my face heavy<br>
<br>
I feel like crying but I know I won't<br>
not because I don't want to but because I can't<br>
I'll try my best but I can't promise you<br>
anymore than just one lonely tear<br>
<br>
today, the sky was vivid and bright<br>
the air smelled nice and the world was smiling<br>
but I guess my sweater is too cloudy grey<br>
I zipped it up because it's no less grey underneath<br>
<br>
I'm not mature for choosing not to talk<br>
I'm not respectful for apologizing<br>
please dear, don't clap for me<br>
I hardly even practiced
