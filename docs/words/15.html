        you are excited to see me when you<br>
        wake up from your warm comfortable nap<br>
        how passionately you smile at me while I <br>
        smirk back embarassed and blushed<br>
        <br>
        and even with my tired eyes and slouch<br>
        I let you take my hand and pull me into the<br> 
        orange wind of sunrise and chirping birds<br>
        in which you gaze at lovingly<br>
        <br>
        and now with my hand on your shoulder<br>
        I am listening to you share your excitement<br>
        for this prescious and limitless world<br>
        that we will soon explore jointly<br>
        <br>
        because our wild outfits are mutual like<br>
        characters from an animated children's movie<br>
        and because the art we make together defines my life<br>
        you are irreplaceable
