        The mistake that many composers make<br>
        is not making enough mistakes.<br>
        Let me ask you this:<br>
        Why are you so afraid of dissonance?<br>
        I like your piece, <br>
        but let's take a look at its melodic scale.<br>
        Why don't we flatten that third?<br>
        or maybe even that sixth?<br>
        Why don't you take the dominant 7th chord<br>
        in your 2-5-1 progression and sharpen that fifth?<br>
        I agree that your music has a pretty face,<br>
        but maybe a pimple or a scar will give it more charm.<br>
        Now, there we have it.<br>
        And don't fix it!<br>
        It's better now because it's more wrong,<br>
        and let's be honest with ourselves.<br>
        We all like to do things that are wrong.
