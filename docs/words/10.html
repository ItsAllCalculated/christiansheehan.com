        She exclaimed to her mother her desire to be loved and respected. An argument emerged as it was a claim that was based on unfair judgment despite coming from emotions that were undeniably true. Her mother, in annoyance, replied with the usual lecture on how she has been there for her since she was born and has done everything in her capacity to guide her in the right direction in life. The back and forth rebuttals that followed were mostly redundant and began to resemble the sound of a broken record. The inability of either of them to understand each other’s perspective created arguments that were almost entirely based in circular reasoning. She soon realized that she was perhaps picking the wrong fight and that likely nothing would come out of that foolish exchange. Besides, it wasn’t her mother that she was upset at, but rather the world.
 <br><br>       It was her anger towards life that she would redirect at other people, and although I see this as an unwise mistake on her behalf, it’s something I understand and empathize with. Since she was young, she has faced a great deal of unfair treatment and hardships, from selfish and dishonest friends to her father leaving her at a young age. For how little I can actually do to affect her life as a mere observer, I spend a lot of my time preoccupied with her problems and with where she is headed in life.  How much I pity her can never be truly expressed. Any sort of communication with her is nearly impossible, but I hope she can at least feel a sense of me. Maybe then, she’ll finally see all of what life has to offer. Not just the painful, but the beautiful as well.
 <br><br>   After leaving the scene with her mother, she made her way upstairs to her bedroom in a calmer and more retrospective mood and pulled out her sketchbook. It had been a while since she last sketched something out. She just had not had the inspiration to express herself in that way, or at least that’s what she would tell herself.
 <br><br>   It’s a gift I envy. Creative expression in that dimension is simply not a talent that I possess. It wasn’t her technical skill though that was so impressive, but rather her ability to visually represent and express her mental afflictions. To take the complexities of one’s mind and put them on paper in such a precious way. How much I wish to be able to enter her aesthetic mind as I can her conscious mind. If only I can understand how each of her pencil strokes are conceived and how they all come together to form a lovely picture. Such a thing is beyond most beings, even myself.
 <br><br>   As I watched her though, I must admit I was caught a little off guard. After all of the gentle strokes of her pencils neatly sorted by their level of hardness, the image that emerged was rather abstract. I didn’t know what to make of it at first and neither could she. She stared at her artwork and reflected. She was confused as to why she couldn’t draw out an explicit representation of how she was feeling. She guessed that maybe she could only abstractly represent someone as abstract as herself. It was strange, it was ambiguous, it could easily be aesthetically criticized, but what was important was that it was sincere. No one else knew that, but she did and so did I. 
 <br><br>   Her reflective thoughts started to drift and they became more broad as she continued to sit there staring at her drawing. She started to consider the idea that maybe the misfortunes and hardships in her life are actually just incidental. Maybe if she wanted to feel loved and valued, all she had to do was believe. Sure, it was presumptuous, maybe even pretentious, but it was a belief that was more than necessary. How else would she avoid the pain in her life? How else would she find the beauty she so longed for? The kind of beauty that gave her life sentimentality. The kind of beauty that paved the way for some great and profound nostalgia. She closed her sketchbook and took a deep breath as she was starting to feel very nervous. I suppose it was her realization that, at some point, she had to face life for all that it is. I hope she eventually does.
