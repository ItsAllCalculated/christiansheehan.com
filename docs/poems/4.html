        if I had your eyes<br>
        so pretty and green<br>
        I could calm the sea<br>
        while the sea sees me<br>
        <br>
        if I had your eyes<br>
        so gentle and precise<br>
        even the scariest things<br>
        could seem all so nice<br>
        <br>
        if I had your eyes<br>
        so darling and true<br>
        I could have the courage<br>
        to face life's view<br>
        <br>
        if I had your eyes<br>
        although I will never<br>
        I know I could<br>
        love myself forever
