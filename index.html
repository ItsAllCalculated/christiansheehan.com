christiansheehan.com is down at the moment. I'm planning on rebuilding this website from the bottom up all over again due to complications with my hosting service and ssl verification. A while ago, my cloudflare account, the service this website uses for encryption and security, got hacked and my website started to redirect people to a virus. In an attempt to quickly solve this issue, I disconnected just about everything I could and now I'm quite lost at the moment as to how to reverse all of these changes. The good news is that I still have all the files to my old website, but I might need to switch my hosting service to something more reliable. This will all be resolved within time and my online portfolio and true home of my creative endeavors will be back up better than ever :)
